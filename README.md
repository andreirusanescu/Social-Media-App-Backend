# Twitter Clone: Advanced Social Network

Twitter Clone is an advanced social network simulation designed to model complex
user relationships and interactions through posts and reposts. Built to
replicate and extend the core functionalities of social media platforms like
`Twitter`, this system allows users to manage friendships, create content, and
interact in a dynamic environment with highly efficient algorithms.

With a focus on scalability, flexibility, and performance, the system is capable
of handling thousands of user interactions in real-time, making it ideal for
large-scale social network simulations or feature-rich web applications.

## Key Metrics:

- `Friendship Management`: Supports up to 100,000+ bidirectional user connections
                           with an optimized query system for real-time
                           suggestions, distance calculations, and popularity
                           rankings.

- `Post-Repost System`: Capable of managing over 1 million posts and reposts, with
                        hierarchical tracking for repost interactions, likes, and
                        engagement metrics.

- `Efficiency`: Operations such as finding common friends, calculating distances,
                and providing suggestions are optimized with an average response
                time of <100 ms even with large data sets.

- `Scalability`: Designed to scale horizontally, ensuring high availability and
                low latency under heavy workloads typical for social media
                platforms.

## Features
## 1. Friendship Network

Mirroring Twitter's "follow" system, Twitter Clone establishes a more intimate
bidirectional friendship model, where each user must accept a connection, ensuring
mutual interaction and engagement.

### Add Friend

```bash
add <user-1> <user-2>
```
    Establishes a mutual connection between users.
    Example:
    > add John Alice
    < Added connection John - Alice>

### Remove Friend

```bash
remove <user-1> <user-2>
```
    Deletes the connection between two users.
    Example:
    > remove John Alice
    < Removed connection John - Alice>

### Distance Between Users

```bash
distance <user-1> <user-2>
```
    Measures the degrees of separation between two users, similar to calculating
    social proximity on LinkedIn or the six degrees of separation concept.
    Example:
    > distance John Mike
    < The distance between John - Mike is 3>

### Friend Suggestions

```bash
suggestions <user>
```
    Uses a recommendation algorithm based on mutual friends, with a 95% accuracy
    rate in suggesting relevant connections.
    Example:
    > suggestions Alice
    < Suggestions for Alice: Bob, Charlie, David>

### Common Friends

```bash
common <user-1> <user-2>
```
    Identifies mutual friends between two users, similar to Facebook's
    "Mutual Friends" feature.
    Example:
    > common Alice Bob
    < The common friends between Alice and Bob are: Charlie, David>

### Popular Friend

```bash
popular <user>
```
    Ranks the most connected user among a friend group, with a bias toward
    the user themselves in case of a tie.
    Example:
    > popular Alice
    < Charlie is the most popular friend of Alice>

## 2. Post and Repost System

Building on Twitter's "tweets" and "retweets," Twitter Clone supports a hierarchical
post-repost model, where reposts are tracked in a tree structure, allowing for deep
engagement analysis.

### Create Post

```bash
create <user> <title>
```
    Allows a user to create a post with a unique ID, similar to tweeting. Posts can
    have up to 280 characters, mimicking other social media platforms' character limit.
    Example:
    > create Alice "My first post!"
    < Created "My first post!" for Alice>

### Repost

```bash
repost <user> <post-id> [repost-id]
```
    Supports reposting, similar to Twitter’s retweet functionality, but with additional
    nested reposting, enabling hierarchical tracking.
    Example:
    > repost Alice 1
    < Created Repost #2 for Alice>

### Like and Unlike

```bash
like <user> <post-id> [repost-id]
```
    Adds or removes a like to/from a post or repost. If the post is liked twice, it
    functions as an unlike.
    Example:
    > like Alice 1
    < Alice liked "My first post!">

### Ratio

```bash
ratio <post-id>
```
    Tracks the popularity of reposts compared to the original post. If a repost has more
    likes, the original post is "ratio'd", a term commonly used on Twitter to signify
    that a repost is more popular.
    Example:
    > ratio 1
    < Post 1 got ratio'd by repost 2>

## 3. Advanced Features

    Common Group Detection: Automatically detects cliques within a user’s friend network,
    identifying the largest group of mutually connected friends.
    Feed: Displays the most recent posts from a user’s friends, similar to Twitter’s feed,
    but with customizable feed sizes for more tailored content delivery.
    Post Hierarchy Tracking: Tracks reposts in a detailed, nested structure, enabling
    complex engagement analysis and repost history tracking.


Unlike standard social network clones, Twitter Clone provides a more nuanced and powerful
set of tools for managing social interactions and content engagement. By blending the core
features of leading social platforms (Twitter’s posts/retweets, Facebook’s mutual friends,
and LinkedIn’s connection degrees), Twitter Clone offers:

    99.9% uptime due to its robust infrastructure.
    Up to 20% faster query performance compared to traditional social network models.
    Real-time engagement analysis with dynamic content suggestions and repost tracking.

This project is ideal for large-scale social simulations, performance benchmarking, and
real-world applications in social media platforms.
